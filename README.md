# rock-paper-scissors
(For the Odin Project's curriculum)

This repo is a functional version of rock paper scissors played against the computer. It serves as 
my first ever Javascript project! The game is played using the Chrome DevTools console. The score 
is kept over a 5-game series, with a winner decided at the end. To play, call the "game()" function 
in the console and follow prompts from the webpage.

This project required me to use the following teachings in Javascript: 
declare variables & store values,
use operators & evaluate arguments with conditionals,
use datatype methods,
use loops,
and write functions with & without input arguments.

The project also showed me that Javascript is written very much like Java (my first learned language).

COMMIT 1/19/2019:
I've revisited this project repo after learning about the DOM (Document Object Model).
This commit updates the game, as it is no longer needed to be played in the DevTools console & fully playable on the page itself. 
I used html for adding & organizing the initial content of the page, then css to style it. 
I used javascript events to create the clickable images & edit the appearance of the page as the game plays out.
